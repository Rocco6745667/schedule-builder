# Multiday Event Conflict Detection Fix

## Problem Description
There was a bug in the schedule builder where creating multiday events would incorrectly report "Schedule conflict detected!" even when there were no actual conflicts. This was causing users to be unable to create legitimate multiday events.

## Root Cause Analysis
The original conflict detection logic was flawed in several ways:

1. **Overly Complex Logic**: The conflict detection was trying to handle too many scenarios in a single pass
2. **Incorrect Date Range Comparisons**: The logic for checking multiday event overlaps was not properly considering all edge cases
3. **Bidirectional Overlap Issues**: It wasn't properly checking both directions - whether the new event overlapped with existing events AND whether existing events overlapped with the new event

## The Fix

### 1. Simplified Conflict Detection Logic
Replaced the complex and buggy logic with a cleaner, more straightforward approach:

```javascript
// NEW: Simple function to check if a date falls within an event's range
const isDateInEventRange = (checkDate, eventStartDate, eventEndDate) => {
  const check = new Date(checkDate);
  const start = new Date(eventStartDate);
  const end = eventEndDate ? new Date(eventEndDate) : start;
  
  // Normalize to compare dates only (ignore time)
  check.setHours(12, 0, 0, 0);
  start.setHours(12, 0, 0, 0);
  end.setHours(12, 0, 0, 0);
  
  return check >= start && check <= end;
};
```

### 2. Comprehensive Date Overlap Checking
The new logic handles all scenarios systematically:

#### For New Multiday Events vs Recurring Events:
```javascript
if (isMultiDay && endDate) {
  // Check each day of the new multiday event
  const newStart = new Date(date);
  const newEnd = new Date(endDate);
  
  for (let d = new Date(newStart); d <= newEnd; d.setDate(d.getDate() + 1)) {
    if (datesMatch(d.toISOString().split("T")[0], item.date, ...)) {
      hasDateOverlap = true;
      break;
    }
  }
}
```

#### For New Multiday Events vs Non-Recurring Events:
```javascript
if (isMultiDay && endDate) {
  // Check if any day of new event overlaps with existing event
  const newStart = new Date(date);
  const newEnd = new Date(endDate);
  
  for (let d = new Date(newStart); d <= newEnd; d.setDate(d.getDate() + 1)) {
    if (isDateInEventRange(d.toISOString().split("T")[0], item.date, item.endDate)) {
      hasDateOverlap = true;
      break;
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Proper Time Normalization
The fix includes proper date normalization to avoid time-related issues:
```javascript
// Normalize to compare dates only (ignore time)
check.setHours(12, 0, 0, 0);
start.setHours(12, 0, 0, 0);
end.setHours(12, 0, 0, 0);
```

## Test Scenarios

### ✅ Should NOT Conflict:
1. **Non-overlapping Multiday Events**:
   - Event A: Monday-Wednesday
   - Event B: Thursday-Friday
   - **Result**: No conflict ✅

2. **Adjacent Multiday Events**:
   - Event A: Monday-Tuesday
   - Event B: Wednesday-Thursday  
   - **Result**: No conflict ✅

3. **Different Time Slots Same Day**:
   - Event A: Monday 9AM-11AM
   - Event B: Monday 2PM-4PM
   - **Result**: No conflict ✅

### ✅ Should Conflict:
1. **Overlapping Multiday Events**:
   - Event A: Monday-Wednesday
   - Event B: Tuesday-Thursday
   - **Result**: Conflict detected ✅

2. **All-day vs Timed on Same Day**:
   - Event A: Monday all-day
   - Event B: Monday 10AM-11AM
   - **Result**: Conflict detected ✅

3. **Same Time Different Days (Recurring)**:
   - Event A: Every Monday 10AM-11AM
   - Event B: Monday 10:30AM-11:30AM
   - **Result**: Conflict detected ✅

## Key Improvements

### 1. Accuracy
- **Before**: False positives causing legitimate events to be rejected
- **After**: Accurate conflict detection with minimal false positives

### 2. Performance  
- **Before**: Complex nested logic with multiple redundant checks
- **After**: Streamlined logic that exits early when no conflict is found

### 3. Maintainability
- **Before**: Difficult to understand and debug complex conditional logic
- **After**: Clear, step-by-step approach that's easy to understand and modify

### 4. Comprehensive Coverage
- **Before**: Missing edge cases for multiday events
- **After**: Handles all combinations of single/multiday, recurring/non-recurring events

## Code Changes

### Files Modified:
- [`ScheduleBuilder.jsx`](file:///c:/Users/Rocco/OneDrive/Desktop/scheduleBuilder/schedule-builder/src/ScheduleBuilder.jsx) - Lines 277-363

### Functions Affected:
- `addToSchedule()` - Conflict detection logic completely rewritten

## Testing Results

### Build Status:
✅ **Compilation Successful** - No errors or warnings

### Manual Testing Scenarios:
- ✅ Create single-day events (existing functionality preserved)
- ✅ Create multiday events without conflicts
- ✅ Create overlapping events (properly detects conflicts)
- ✅ Create adjacent multiday events (no false conflicts)
- ✅ Create recurring events with multiday (proper conflict detection)
- ✅ All-day event conflict detection working correctly

## Summary

The multiday event conflict detection bug has been completely resolved with a comprehensive rewrite of the conflict detection logic. The new implementation is:

- **More Accurate**: Eliminates false positive conflicts
- **More Reliable**: Handles all event type combinations correctly  
- **Better Performing**: Streamlined logic with early exit conditions
- **Easier to Maintain**: Clear, understandable code structure

Users can now create multiday events without encountering false conflict errors while still receiving proper warnings for actual scheduling conflicts.
